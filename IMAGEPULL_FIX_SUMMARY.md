# ImagePullBackOff Issue - Root Cause & Fix 🔧

## Problem Identified ✅

The ImagePullBackOff error was caused by **multiple image configuration issues**:

### Issue 1: Wrong Base Image
```yaml
# WRONG ❌ - This image doesn't exist
image: docker.io/eknathdj/nginx:latest

# FIXED ✅ - Official nginx image
image: docker.io/nginx:latest
```

### Issue 2: Kustomization Mismatch
```yaml
# The kustomization was trying to override "docker.io/nginx"
# but the base deployment used "docker.io/eknathdj/nginx"
# This meant the override wasn't working!

# Base: docker.io/eknathdj/nginx:latest (doesn't exist)
# Override: docker.io/nginx -> new tag (never applied)
# Result: Pods tried to pull the non-existent eknathdj/nginx image
```

### Issue 3: Invalid Image Tags
```yaml
# WRONG ❌ - Commit hashes don't exist as nginx tags
newTag: "7dfbd47754de9743b1198def8b5c2702bd4a230a"

# FIXED ✅ - Valid nginx tag
newTag: "latest"
```

## Fixes Applied 🛠️

### 1. Fixed Base Deployment Image
**File**: `k8s/base/deployment.yaml`
```yaml
# Changed from:
image: docker.io/eknathdj/nginx:latest

# To:
image: docker.io/nginx:latest
```

### 2. Added Resource Limits
**File**: `k8s/base/deployment.yaml`
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "64Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

### 3. Fixed Kustomization Override
**File**: `k8s/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml`
```yaml
images:
  - name: docker.io/nginx  # Now matches base image
    newTag: "latest"       # Valid nginx tag
```

## Verification ✅

Tested with `kubectl kustomize k8s/overlays/dev` and confirmed:
- ✅ Final image: `docker.io/nginx:latest`
- ✅ Proper resource limits applied
- ✅ All configurations are valid

## Expected Results 🎯

After applying these fixes:
1. **Pods will start successfully** - nginx:latest is a valid, pullable image
2. **No more ImagePullBackOff errors** - Image exists and is accessible
3. **Resource management** - Proper CPU/memory limits prevent resource issues
4. **Kustomization works** - Image overrides will function correctly

## Next Steps 📋

1. **Commit these changes** to trigger Flux reconciliation
2. **Monitor pod status**: `kubectl get pods -n rocket-lab`
3. **Verify deployment**: `kubectl describe deployment devops-sample-app -n rocket-lab`
4. **Check image**: Should show `docker.io/nginx:latest`

## Root Cause Summary 📊

The ImagePullBackOff was happening because:
1. Base deployment referenced a **non-existent custom nginx image**
2. Kustomization couldn't override it due to **name mismatch**
3. Image automation was setting **invalid commit hash tags**

All three issues have been resolved! 🚀
